## Jenkins and its stages

Jenkins is an open source continuous integration/continuous delivery and deployment (CI/CD) automation software DevOps tool; It is used to implement CI/CD workflows, called pipelines.

As well as Jenkins, there are also other automation servers such as Bamboo and TeamCity. These automation servers all share similar capabilities however Jenkinsâ€™ highlights are its community and many plugins whilst Bamboo and TeamCity focus on product integrations such as Jira and IntelliJ.

A stage (or stage block) is a specific part of a task performed through the pipeline; for example, build, test, deploy.
